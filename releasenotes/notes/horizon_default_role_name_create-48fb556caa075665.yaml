    The ``horizon_default_role_name`` (default `member`) Keystone role existence
    is no longer ensured by the Horizon role.
    It is expected that the role defined by ``horizon_default_role_name``
    already exists in Keystone and was bootstrapped via ``keystone-bootstrap``
    command during ``os_keystone`` execution.
    You can leverage ``opestack.osa.openstack_resources`` playbook to create
    extra roles if you need/want to use non-default value for the
    ``horizon_default_role_name`` variable
